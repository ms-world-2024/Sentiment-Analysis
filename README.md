# Sentiment Analysis Using Movie Reviews

## Overview

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of movie reviews using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify movie reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments based on the textual content. The project demonstrates the application of machine learning models and NLP methods to analyze and interpret sentiments from a dataset of movie reviews.

## Features

- **Sentiment Classification:** Classifies reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
- **Text Preprocessing:** Implements techniques like tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
- **Model Training:** Uses machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests for sentiment classification.
- **Evaluation:** Measures model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization:** Provides visualizations of sentiment distribution and model performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - **Natural Language Processing:** NLTK, spaCy
  - **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn
